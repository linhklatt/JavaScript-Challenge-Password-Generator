# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

For this challenge, I was given finished HTML, CSS code and undone/starter JS Code. My job is to write full JS code to create an application called Password Generator which is allowed users to generate a random password base on their need. They have 4 options to choose including : numbers, lower cases, upper cases and special character and the length limited from 8 to 128 characters. When the users have choose their options, the application will run and give them the random password base on the users choices!

## Usage
